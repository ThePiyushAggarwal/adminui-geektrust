## How to run the Project locally

- Create a `.env` file and paste the contents of `.env.example` into it. (Since we don't have any important credentials, the end-point is already there.)
- Run `npm i` in the root folder to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server locally at default port.
