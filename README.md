## How to run the Project locally

- Create a `.env` file and paste the contents of `.env.example` into it. (Since we don't have any important credentials, the values are already there with the keys.)
- Run `npm i` in the root folder to install all dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server locally at default port.

## Tech Used

- React 18 + TypeScript setup using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) - to manage state for components far apart in structure
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - to fetch data from API
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - for styling the components
- Linear Gradient used is from [She Codes](https://gradients.shecodes.io/gradients/118)
